## Keybase

[![GuardRails badge](https://badges.production.guardrails.io/moul/client.svg)](https://www.guardrails.io)

Welcome to the Keybase client repo.  All our client apps (OSX, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android) are being actively developed in this repository. Please, dig around.

### However, if all you want to do is run Keybase...

**[Visit our release page!](https://keybase.io/download)** 
 
We're moving fast and can't help debug your build right now. Plus, some of the things in this repo are explorations, and the app you build from source just *might not do what it says it's doing*. So, if you just want to install Keybase on your computer, you should **[get the appropriate release](https://keybase.io/download)** for OSX, Linux, or Windows.

That said, we'd love you to read through our source code.
